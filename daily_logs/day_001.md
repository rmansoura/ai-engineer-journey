# Day 1: Environment Setup

## Objectives
1.  Ensure you have a code editor (VS Code recommended).
2.  Set up a Python Virtual Environment.
3.  Run your first Jupyter Notebook.

## Steps

### 1. Install VS Code
Since the `code` command wasn't found, you might need to install VS Code or add it to your PATH.
- Download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- After installing, open the "Command Palette" (Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH".

### 2. Set up a Project Directory
We have already created `ai-engineer-roadmap` for you.
Open this folder in VS Code.

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
In your terminal (inside VS Code), run:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
You should see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 4. Install Dependencies
We need `jupyter` and `pandas` to start.
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas
```

### 5. Create a Notebook
1.  Create a new file named `hello_ai.ipynb`.
2.  In the first cell, type:
    ```python
    print("Hello, AI Engineer!")
    import pandas as pd
    print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
    ```
3.  Run the cell (Shift+Enter).

## Assignment
Complete the steps above. Once done, let me know, and we will move to Day 2!
