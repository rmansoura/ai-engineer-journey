# Day 1: Environment Setup

## Objectives
1.  Ensure you have a code editor (VSCodium).
2.  Set up a Python Virtual Environment using `uv`.
3.  Run your first Jupyter Notebook.

## Steps

### 1. Install VSCodium Extensions
You mentioned you have VSCodium installed. Great choice!
To ensure you have the best experience, install the Python and Jupyter extensions.
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install Python extension
codium --install-extension ms-python.python

# Install Jupyter extension
codium --install-extension ms-toolsai.jupyter
```

These extensions will provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and notebook support.

### 2. Install `uv`
We have installed `uv` for you using Homebrew.
You can verify it by running:
```bash
uv --version
```

### 3. Initialize Project
If you have cloned this repository, the project is already initialized.
Simply run:
```bash
uv sync
```
This will install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` into a virtual environment.

If you were starting from scratch, you would run `uv init` and then `uv add jupyter pandas`.

### 4. Verify Installation
Check if the environment is set up correctly:
```bash
uv run python --version
```

### 5. Create a Notebook
You have two options to work with notebooks:

**Option A: Inside VSCodium (Recommended)**
1.  Create a new file named `hello_ai.ipynb`.
2.  In the first cell, type:
    ```python
    print("Hello, AI Engineer!")
    import pandas as pd
    print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
    ```
3.  **Select Kernel**:
    *   **Method A (UI)**: Look for "Select Kernel" or "Python 3..." in the top right corner of the notebook editor.
    *   **Method B (Command Palette)**: If you don't see the button:
        1.  Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
        2.  Type "Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel".
        3.  Select "Python Environments" -> ".venv".
4.  Run the cell (Shift+Enter).

**Option B: Browser Interface**
1.  Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    uv run jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Click the link displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8888/...`).
3.  Create a new notebook from the browser interface.

## Assignment
Complete the steps above. Once done, let me know, and we will move to Day 2!
