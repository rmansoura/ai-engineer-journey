# AI Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to your journey to becoming an AI Engineer! This roadmap is designed to take you from a technical background (TSE) to a proficient AI Engineer.

## Philosophy
- **Consistency is key**: Small daily progress is better than sporadic bursts.
- **Hands-on**: We will build things, not just read about them.
- **Modern Stack**: We will focus on Python, PyTorch, and modern LLM frameworks.

## The Roadmap at a Glance

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
- **Goal**: Master Python for Data Science and refresh essential Mathematics.
- **Tools**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Math**: Linear Algebra, Calculus (derivatives), Probability.

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Basics (Weeks 5-8)
- **Goal**: Understand core ML algorithms and how to apply them.
- **Tools**: Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- **Concepts**: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Evaluation Metrics.

### Phase 3: Deep Learning (Weeks 9-12)
- **Goal**: Build and train Neural Networks.
- **Tools**: PyTorch.
- **Concepts**: Backpropagation, CNNs (Vision), RNNs (Sequences).

### Phase 4: The Age of LLMs & GenAI (Weeks 13-16)
- **Goal**: Work with Large Language Models and Generative AI.
- **Tools**: Hugging Face, OpenAI API, LangChain/LlamaIndex.
- **Concepts**: Transformers, Attention Mechanism, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), Fine-tuning.

### Phase 5: Engineering & Deployment (Weeks 17-20)
- **Goal**: Deploy models to production.
- **Tools**: Docker, FastAPI, Cloud (AWS/GCP), MLOps basics.
